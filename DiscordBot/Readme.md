# Squash Elo Rating System

Author: Aarav Sibbal

This program this made for the purpose of Carleton University Squash Club. 

To run this program make sure you have a postgres db and run the commands on it which in the db.sql. 

after this make sure you have the all the connection variables in a .env file like the db name, password, host, port. 

ask me for a link that would let you add it to a server that you are a admin in at: aaravsibbal.15@gmail.com

- I will try to email you the link within 48 hrs. 

To run the program after all the set up run the command:

```go run main.go```

Host this where you want and use it. 

**Note:** I am subjected to not give you the link if I am using the bot actively. 

**Note:** But if you want you can use this source code with a bot you register with discord just make sure you have enabled "Message Content Intent" which is under Bot section of the Discord Dev Portal. This way I am not involved in the process at all which is amazing for me as well.
